      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p> Hello. My name is Sang. This page is provided to help you learn more about me. Before I start with a quick
        bio, I want to thank you for taking the time to visit. </p>
      <p> I currently reside in Seattle, WA. I have been a transplant to the Pacific Northwest (PNW) since 2015. My wife
        and I both work in the technology sector and have couple of rug rats in tow. I am currently taking some time off
        from the industry to tackle personal projects (e.g. home improvement) and growth (e.g. learning to code!). Prior
        to the tech industry, I served active duty in the U.S. Air Force for about 10 years. </P>

      <!-- [Story 1, Task 1] This is the Goals div: it describes my goal for being part of code fellows-->
      <h2>Goals (e.g. Why Code Fellows?)</h2>
      <p> My goal in attending Code Fellows is to build my software development technical skills. I have been working
        with software (and hardware) developers but in order to better understand the "under the hood" technology, I
        wanted to get more hands-on developer experience. </p>
