# LAB - 02

## Project "About Me"
A web page that provides information about its author using an interactive Q&A game. 

### Features (by version and release date)
**version 1.3, released on 31 Oct 2020:** Updated .css for additional styling.

**version 1.2, released on 29 Oct 2020:** The entire questionnaire has been converted using Functions in the .js file. 

**version 1.1, released on 28 Oct 2020:** The questionnaire was updated with two new Q&A games. First is a number guessing game; second is a guess my favorite Halloween treat game. It also added a score tracker to provide to user at the end of the game.

**version 1.0, released on 27 Oct 2020:** The webpage asks for the user's name which is used to customize the responses back to the user using an *alert* dialog box. It provides 5 yes/no question prompts to the user, and then provides the user with feedback on their answer.

## Reflections and Comments (with Release label)
31 Oct 2020 Release (Lab 5b):
+ Overall, feel prett good with my .js and html progress. My css styling is far behind.

29 Oct 2020 Release (Lab 4):
+ The update for this release was, in part, completed with pair programming. Seid was my paired programmer. We worked through problem 1-5 and problem 6 as driver/navigator to get the concept. We were limited on time and as this was our first pair programming experience, which took us a while to just get things set up and get a flow going.  
+ Overall, I enjoyed the experience and found pair programming to be effective and productive. While we didn't move as quickly through actual writing of the code; I think we were quicker on figuring out the concept and problem solving -- which meant that the actual coding part was faster after the pair programming session.
+ Pair programming could also helps to prevent the urge to "dive right in to coding" which can be wasteful when the problem hasn't been either fully understood or thought through. We were able to ask each other questions if something was off or unclear, which forced us to think through the concept and the problem before getting too much code down. 

28 Oct 2020 Release (Lab 3):
+ Was able to get most HTML and JS update within couple of hours. Then spent couple of hours debugging my JS to finally get it to work. What got me were:
  - The task on providing the final message if the user exhausted their attempts. Not intuitive, for me, but once I figured it out, it totally made sense -- though I am unsure if this is the best/right approach.
  - The proper iteration set-up for my FOR-loop
  - Figuring out missing parenthesis; this alone took about an hour (no TA was available to help while I was working on it). At one point, I started to mess with my loop logic, but then stopped myself and then drew a flow chart diagram to make sure my logic was sound. And because my flow was logical, I suspected syntax error -- luckily, I was right and was able to figure it out going line by line -- will need to find out if there is a more efficient way to identify these types of syntax error rather than going line by line.
+ Overall, very satisfying lab and great learnings. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, wasn't able to do much was CSS style improvements or attempt the stretch goals.

27 Oct 2020 Release (Lab 2):
+ Building on 102; I found the exercise of "by the numbers" (military slang) approach to HTML/CSS/JS. As an example, just the introducion of reset.css to forego the basic formatting offered by browser to make sure I, as a developer, have 'full control' of the style and use CSS to execute that style was very instructive and insightful. 
+ One thing that I have **not** been doing is reviewing the end of chapter code examples in detail -- I go back to them, if time permits, but in trying to get the core reading in, I have been using it as a stretch goal. Based on my most recent reading, however, I need to find a way to incorporate this into my core reading.
+ I misunderstood part of the instruction about the customized greeting and farewell message. It was good to explore trying to incorporate that onto the page (e.g. I tried with using `document.write()` but was not able to do it.  I was thankful for the 15 minute rule, so I didn't spend too much time chasing that rabbit hole after confirming with the TA that this was not part of the assignment.
+ I estimated about 4 hours to complete the lab prior to staring it and it took about that long (cumulatively, not one straight shot).
